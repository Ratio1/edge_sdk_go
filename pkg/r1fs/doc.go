// Package r1fs exposes a client for the Ratio1 File Service (R1FS).
// It mirrors the REST endpoints implemented in
// extensions/business/r1fs/r1fs_manager_api.py within the Ratio1 edge_node
// repository. Several high-level operations (stat, list, delete) are currently
// stubs pending upstream support and are documented with TODO markers.
